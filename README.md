## Notes

Hello there at MVF! 


First of all I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity, I really anjoyed this challenge and I hope, that you will like the result.

I would like to point out some small things: 


1. I was using absolute paths for images, so you will need to run local server in order to see them. I did set up script for webpack-dev-server -> npm run dev

2. Website is responsive.

3. In terms of JavaScript, I was using ES6 Vanilla JS and I tried to implement a bit more functionality (custom dropdowns, options block-card).

4. I made Modal window as ES6 class, just for demonstration purposes.


Looking forward to hearing from you guys!
